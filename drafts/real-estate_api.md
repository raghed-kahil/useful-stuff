### Project Requirements: Backend Service for Real Estate Management (PaaS Model)

#### Overview
The backend service should be built in **Node.js** and follow the **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** model. This approach allows multiple companies to leverage a shared platform infrastructure while maintaining their data separation and management. The platform will handle property, user, and company management while offering scalability, flexibility, and ease of integration with other services.

### Core Features
1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**:
   - The system should support **multi-tenancy**, where multiple companies (tenants) use the same platform with data isolation.
   - Each tenant (company) will have its own users and properties, and the data will be logically separated.
   - The platform should be flexible enough to scale with new tenants (companies) and grow in terms of features and performance.

2. **RESTful API**:
   - A RESTful API should be provided for each company (tenant) to manage its users, properties, and related operations.
   - Proper versioning (`/api/v1`) should be used to ensure backward compatibility as the platform evolves.

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Property Management
- **Property Attributes**:
   - `id` (unique identifier, auto-generated)
   - `code` (string, unique per company)
   - `sales_code` (string, unique per property)
   - `area` (number, in square meters)
   - `price` (number, in USD)
   - `status` (enum, e.g., available, sold, rented)
   - `type` (enum, e.g., apartment, house, commercial)

- **API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /companies/:companyId/properties`: List all properties for a company (tenant).
   - `GET /companies/:companyId/properties/:id`: Get details of a single property.
   - `POST /companies/:companyId/properties`: Create a new property (admin only).
   - `PUT /companies/:companyId/properties/:id`: Update property details (admin or company user).
   - `DELETE /companies/:companyId/properties/:id`: Remove a property (admin or company user).

#### 2. Company Management
- **Company Attributes**:
   - `id` (unique identifier, auto-generated)
   - `name` (string, company name)
   - `address` (string)
   - `contact_email` (string)

- **API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /companies`: List all companies (admin only).
   - `GET /companies/:id`: Get details of a single company.
   - `POST /companies`: Create a new company (admin only).
   - `PUT /companies/:id`: Update company details (admin or company user).
   - `DELETE /companies/:id`: Remove a company (admin only).

#### 3. User Management
- **User Attributes**:
   - `id` (unique identifier, auto-generated)
   - `name` (string, user’s name)
   - `email` (string, unique)
   - `role` (enum, e.g., admin, company_user)
   - `companyIds` (array, list of company IDs the user belongs to)

- **API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /companies/:companyId/users`: List all users for a company.
   - `GET /companies/:companyId/users/:id`: Get details of a single user.
   - `POST /companies/:companyId/users`: Create a new user (admin only).
   - `PUT /companies/:companyId/users/:id`: Update user details (admin or user).
   - `DELETE /companies/:companyId/users/:id`: Remove a user (admin only).

### Roles and Permissions

#### 1. **Admin**
   - Can manage all users, companies, and properties across the entire platform.
   - Can add/remove companies, users, and properties.
   - Full access to all CRUD operations.

#### 2. **Company User**
   - Can manage properties within their assigned company/companies.
   - Can update and delete properties they are associated with.
   - Cannot manage other users or companies.
   - Can access multiple companies if they belong to more than one.

### PaaS-Specific Features

#### 1. **Tenant Isolation**:
   - Each company (tenant) will have logical isolation of data (properties, users, etc.).
   - The platform must ensure proper **data isolation** so one company's data is not accessible by another company.
   - Each tenant will be identified by a unique company ID (`companyId`), passed with every request to the API.

#### 2. **Scalability**:
   - The platform should scale automatically as new companies/tenants are added.
   - Support for horizontal scaling (e.g., via **containerization** and **microservices**) for API requests to balance load.
   - Databases should support multi-tenancy (e.g., **PostgreSQL** schemas per tenant or MongoDB collections per tenant).

#### 3. **Custom Tenant Settings**:
   - Each company should have customizable settings like allowed property types, price ranges, user roles, etc.
   - **API Endpoints** for configuring these settings should be provided:
     - `GET /companies/:companyId/settings`: Fetch tenant-specific settings.
     - `PUT /companies/:companyId/settings`: Update tenant-specific settings.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - **JWT-based authentication** for secure access to the API.
   - Each company and user must authenticate and obtain a token specific to their company (tenant) to access resources.
   - **Role-based authorization** to control admin and company user access to specific endpoints.

#### 2. **Multi-Tenant Data Management**:
   - Data isolation must be guaranteed for tenants by using unique `companyId` for database queries.
   - Centralized database for all tenants or separate databases per tenant, depending on the expected scale of the platform.

#### 3. **Database**:
   - Use a relational database like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** with multi-tenant support (e.g., schema-based isolation or tenant column).
   - The database should support relationships between users, companies, and properties with the necessary foreign keys and constraints.

#### 4. **API Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement **API rate limiting** per tenant to ensure fair usage of resources and avoid abuse (e.g., `X requests per minute` per company).

#### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Log important events such as property creation, user registration, and errors at the tenant level.
   - Integrate monitoring tools like **Prometheus** or **Datadog** to track API performance and usage per tenant.

#### 6. **Security**:
   - Follow best security practices for PaaS (e.g., secure multi-tenant access, encrypted communications, and isolation of tenant data).
   - Implement **SSL/TLS** for secure data transfer.
   - Protect against **injection attacks**, **CSRF**, and **XSS** vulnerabilities.

#### 7. **Deployment and Scaling**:
   - Use a **PaaS provider** like **Heroku**, **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, or **Google Cloud App Engine** to manage the platform's infrastructure.
   - Implement **continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines for automatic updates and patches.

#### 8. **Tenant Provisioning**:
   - Automated company/tenant creation when a new company registers.
   - Allocate resources, databases, and configurations dynamically upon tenant registration.

### Conclusion
This backend service follows the PaaS model and is designed to scale, with multi-tenancy and tenant-specific isolation for property, company, and user management. It will provide a RESTful API that ensures data security, performance, and ease of use for multiple companies (tenants).
